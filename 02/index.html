                    Another Google URL request parameter is TBS. Like with TBM, 
                    I have not found any info on what TBS might stand for. In 
                    the comments below, Johnny suggests it could stand for “Term
                     By Search”.TBS is a request parameter that shows up in the
                      Google search URL if you do a search of any kind and then
                       press the Search Tools button at the upper end of the search
                        results page, right below the search query field, and select
                         something. TBS is like a general container of many different
                          types of parameters which in turn have values that follow
                           a colon sign. Those parameters are picked up and treated
                            internally by Google’s servers. For example, following a
                             regular search, you can change from “Any time ” and 
                             “All results” to “Past week” and “Sites with images”. 
                             Regarding the time frame of the latest update, TBS can
                              have the following values.
